#Project Structure

- MVVM : The well-ordered and perhaps the most reusable way to organize your code is to use the 'MVVM' pattern. The Model, View, ViewModel (MVVM pattern) is all about guiding you in how to organize and structure your code to write maintainable, testable and extensible applications.


#Dependency Management

- No Third Party required ;)

#Minimum iOS Version Requirement 

- 14.0 
- It’s useful to make an early decision on the minimum iOS version you want to support in your project: knowing which OS versions you need to develop and test against, and which system APIs you can rely on, helps you estimate your workload, and enables you to determine what’s possible and what’s not.


#Unit Test Case

- Setup the test case for data verification
